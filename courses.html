      Are you considering using R in your team or organization, or taking your team's
      R skills to the next level? Then an on-site training course may be
      a valuable step in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
      While there are many online resources for learning R, there are benefits
      to a more focused course/workshop where participants are provided with
      a common foundation for working effectively and collaboratively with R.
      </p>
      <p>
      R is a very flexible and powerful language, and to get the most out of
      it, a solid understanding of the langauge syntax and idioms is essential.
      </p>
      <p>
      Stefan offers training in R and RStudio, both at introductory and
      intermediate to advanced levels, and ad-hoc consulting tasks.
      For information on how a course can be structured to meet your organizations'
      needs you can contact Stefan either by Email or phone.
